        "Welcome to our PyTorch tutorial for the Deep Learning course 2020 at the University of Amsterdam! The following notebook is meant to give a short introduction to PyTorch basics, and get you setup for writing your own neural networks. PyTorch is an open source machine learning framework that allows you to write your own neural networks and optimize them efficiently. However, PyTorch is not the only framework of its kind. Alternatives to PyTorch include [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax#quickstart-colab-in-the-cloud) and [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/). We choose to teach PyTorch at the University of Amsterdam because it is well established, has a huge developer community (originally developed by Facebook), is very flexible and especially used in research. Many current papers publish their code in PyTorch, and thus it is good to be familiar with PyTorch as well.\n",
        "Meanwhile, TensorFlow (developed by Google) is usually known for being a production-grade deep learning library. Still, if you know one machine learning framework in depth, it is very easy to learn another one because many of them use the same concepts and ideas. For instance, TensorFlow's version 2 was heavily inspired by the most popular features of PyTorch, making the frameworks even more similar.\n",
        "If you are already familiar with PyTorch and have created your own neural network projects, feel free to just skim this notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "We are of course not the first ones to create a PyTorch tutorial. There are many great tutorials online, including the [\"60-min blitz\"](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html) on the official [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/). Yet, we choose to create our own tutorial which is designed to give you the basics particularly necessary for the practicals, but still understand how PyTorch works under the hood. Over the next few weeks, we will also keep exploring new PyTorch features in the series of Jupyter notebook tutorials about deep learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will use a set of standard libraries that are often used in machine learning projects. If you are running this notebook on Google Colab, all libraries should be pre-installed. If you are running this notebook locally, make sure you have installed our `dl2020` environment and have activated it."

        "One of the main reasons for using PyTorch in Deep Learning projects is that we can automatically get **gradients/derivatives** of functions that we define. We will mainly use PyTorch for implementing neural networks, and they are just fancy functions. If we use weight matrices in our function that we want to learn, then those are called the **parameters** or simply the **weights**.\n",
        "\n",
        "If our neural network would output a single scalar value, we would talk about taking the **derivative**, but you will see that quite often we will have **multiple** output variables (\"values\"); in that case we talk about **gradients**. It's a more general term.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given an input $\\mathbf{x}$, we define our function by **manipulating** that input, usually by matrix-multiplications with weight matrices and additions with so-called bias vectors. As we manipulate our input, we are automatically creating a **computational graph**. This graph shows how to arrive at our output from our input.\n",
        "PyTorch is a **define-by-run** framework; this means that we can just do our manipulations, and PyTorch will keep track of that graph for us. Thus, we create a dynamic computation graph along the way.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, to recap: the only thing we have to do is to compute the **output**, and then we can ask PyTorch to automatically get the **gradients**.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Note:  Why do we want gradients?** Consider that we have defined a function, a neural net, that is supposed to compute a certain output $y$ for an input vector $\\mathbf{x}$. We then define an **error measure** that tells us how wrong our network is; how bad it is in predicting output $y$ from input $\\mathbf{x}$. Based on this error measure, we can use the gradients to **update** the weights $\\mathbf{W}$ that were responsible for the output, so that the next time we present input $\\mathbf{x}$ to our network, the output will be closer to what we want.\n",

The data loader communicates with the dataset using the function `__getitem__`, and stacks its outputs as tensors over the first dimension to form a batch.\n",
        "In contrast to the dataset class, we usually don't have to define our own data loader class, but can just create an object of it with the dataset as input. Additionally, we can configure our data loader with the following input arguments (only a selection, see full list [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader)):\n",

        "* `batch_size`: Number of samples to stack per batch\n",
        "* `shuffle`: If True, the data is returned in a random order. This is important during training for introducing stochasticity.\n",
        "* `num_workers`: Number of subprocesses to use for data loading. The default, 0, means that the data will be loaded in the main process which can slow down training for datasets where loading a data point takes a considerable amount of time (e.g. large images). More workers are recommended for those, but can cause issues on Windows computers. For tiny datasets as ours, 0 workers are usually faster.\n",
        "* `pin_memory`: If True, the data loader will copy Tensors into CUDA pinned memory before returning them. This can save some time for large data points on GPUs. Usually a good practice to use for a training set, but not necessarily for validation and test to save memory on the GPU.\n",
        "* `drop_last`: If True, the last batch is dropped in case it is smaller than the specified batch size. This occurs when the dataset size is not a multiple of the batch size. Only potentially helpful during training to keep a consistent batch size.\n",

However, PyTorch already provides a list of predefined loss functions which we can use (see [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#loss-functions) for a full list). For instance, for BCE, PyTorch has two modules: `nn.BCELoss()`, `nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()`. While `nn.BCELoss` expects the inputs $x$ to be in the range $[0,1]$, i.e. the output of a sigmoid, `nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss` combines a sigmoid layer and the BCE loss in a single class. This version is numerically more stable than using a plain Sigmoid followed by a BCE loss because of the logarithms applied in the loss function. Hence, it is adviced to use loss functions applied on \"logits\" where possible (remember to not apply a sigmoid on the output of the model in this case!). For our model defined above, we therefore use the module `nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss`."

Stochastic Gradient Descent updates parameters by multiplying the gradients with a small constant, called learning rate, and subtracting those from the parameters (hence minimizing the loss).

If we would call the `backward` function on the loss while the parameter gradients are non-zero from the previous batch, the new gradients would actually be added to the previous ones instead of overwriting them. This is done because a parameter might occur multiple times in a computation graph, and we need to sum the gradients in this case instead of replacing them.

However, there is still much more to PyTorch we haven't discussed yet. In the comming series of Jupyter notebooks, we will discover more and more functionalities of PyTorch, so that you also get familiar to PyTorch concepts beyond the basics. If you are already interested in learning more of PyTorch, we recommend the official [tutorial website](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/) that contains many tutorials on various topics. Especially logging with Tensorboard ([tutorial here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/tensorboard_tutorial.html)) is a good practice that we will explore from Tutorial 5 on."
